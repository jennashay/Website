            The American Folk Art Museum had an opportunity to collaborate with Islamic art expert and artist Sabiha Al Khemir to develop a children's book based on the drawings and writings of Dr. Khemir's interpretation of the famous stories. This exciting book design project had many challenges. The collection of stories had to be presented in both English and Arabic script. Despite a limited selection of plot moments depicted in Dr. Khemir's artworks, every page had to be colorful, graphic, and the flow had to be paced like a storybook.

          <div class="m5 mb20">
            In order to present the story in both English and Arabic, each language is presented separately back to back. The English section is read from the front cover, from left page to right. When flipped over, the Arabic section reads from back the back cover, from the right page to the left. <br /> <br />
With a limited number of illustrations, creating a storybook with imagery depicting each moment in the stories was a challenge. The solution was to isolate components of the original illustrations in Photoshop and blend characters, foregrounds, backgrounds, and textural elements seemlessly together into constructed scenes.
